<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Suranaree University of Technology.
after graduated from university, my intention was to come back home and take a rest for a few months before finding a job.

but the COVID-19 has had a huge impact on aviation industry.So I tried many ways to get a job, to do something for a living,
such as finding a job as a mechanical engineer , doing gardening. but that's not what I wanted to do.</p>

<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One and a half year passed.I found myself discouraged and depressed. I didn't know what to do. I didn't think about my future.
I just lived without any plans. but my parents and my friends, especially my mom.
they showed me the way, made me think and changed my mind.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the past. I thought I was unable to get a job because there was no job about aviation or related to my field, that made me to find another job.
I thought it was hard to get a job, that not what I've learned.</p>

<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I realize that it's not about what I am going to do.
I've failed because I stopped learning , practising and improving myself. I've changed my mindset and I'll never stop learning.
Because I believe that <i>" Practice doesn't make Perfect, but practice only makes for improvement. " - <small>Les Brown</small></i></p>

<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After trying to find my goals, I finally found my passion. I decided to learn programming. 
I don't know that I can learn, do it well or have a good job. But everyday I woke up in the morning,
I enjoyed programming and I wanted to learn more. Although I can learn by myself, I think it'll take a long time to be successful in career path.
and this is a good time to come outside, to be grown up and I hope I'm the one who you are looking for.</p>
